C++ implementation of my python project [https://github.com/JuanPabloZed/IR_Maker](url)

Voxengo's Deconvolver utility, but free and with more features (IR visualisation...)


HOW TO MAKE AN IR
This application is based on the use of Angelo Farina's ESS method. To sum up, the ESS method consists in the following : 
	1- Generate an  exponential sine sweep (ESS) signal (can be done with IR Maker)
	2- Play the ESS through a speaker, a guitar cab, anything you want to characterize/capture
	3- Record the response of the ESS through the system you want to capture
	4- Turn on IR Maker and let it guide you through the process !

 Important note : the application only supports 16, 24 & 32 bit WAV files.

 Multichannel implementation is in the works too, stay tuned !
